Psuedocode:

what needs to be done, not how

initialize data (arrays of constraints and statements)
ask how many teams
name the teams
create game object (game number, # of teams and their names; //timed default 0 meaning to timer)
ask how many rounds
create rounds object (contains constraints and statements, tied to game object)
// pick the timer value and change on game object - add later
set up event listeners (callback functions)
  game advance
  quit
  new game
  // timer timed out
  update score
message
  space to continue/ advance game
  q to quit
  e edit  
space bar shows
  countdown (3 2 1), time before next one shows
  show constraint and statement
  // check for timer, start if true (callback?)
quit
  prompt are you sure
  if no, return
  if yes, thanks for playing
new game
  starts over
timer timed out
  ding ding
  time's up, press space bar to continue??
update score
  choose which team gets a point
  update on the screen
when rounds end, show which team won
ask play again
  same team, ask how any rounds and change rounds object
  different teams, create new game object and rounds object
  

think about:
  function to disable event listeners, when editing, for example
  function to reenable event listeners (use same function that sets them up?)
  
  semaphore
